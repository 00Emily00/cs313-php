    Hello, my name is Emily and I am a junior in college. I am studying Software Engineering and i love it. Aside from programming, I really enjoy doing other things. I love do sports like basketball and soccer. I really like to cook and bake. My favorite thing to bake is pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. I also enjoy to dance and sing.<br><br>
    
     One of my favorite things to do is take pictures. The picture on the left is one I took while I was on a hike this past summer
